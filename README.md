Data Exploration and Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring numerical data distributions to prepare it for machine learning models. Key objectives include:
1)Understanding feature distributions.
2)Identifying outliers or skewed data.
3)Preparing the data for modeling.

Key Features
*Histograms: Visualize the spread of numerical features for insights.
*Feature Evaluation: Highlighted relevant features for analysis.
*Preprocessing Guidance: Suggested steps for scaling, removing outliers, and transformations based on data distribution.

Tools and Libraries Used
*Python
*Matplotlib (for histograms)
*Pandas and Numpy (for data preprocessing)

How to Run
*Load the dataset in Python.
*Use the provided scripts to generate histograms and review distributions.
*Apply preprocessing based on histogram insights (e.g., scaling, outlier removal).

Key Learnings
*Feature distributions can impact machine learning models significantly.
*Visualizing data provides clear guidance for preprocessing.

Next Steps
Implement preprocessing techniques.
Train machine learning models with prepared data.
